Problem:
A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property.
If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers,
you have the same value you started with.

Consider a positive whole number n with d digits.
We square n to arrive at a number that is either 2 x d digits long or (2 x d) -1 digits long.
Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must be d digits long.
The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

Example:
n = 5
d = 1

First calculate that n^2 = 25.
Split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5. Test 2 + 5 = 7 !=5,
so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n^2 = 81.
This gives us 1 + 8 = 9, the original n.

Note: r may have leading zeros.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the ORIGINAL Kaprekar Number (spot the difference!):

In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square
in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.
For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.

Given two positive integers p and q where p is lower than q, write a program to print the modified Kaprekar numbers
in the range between p and q, inclusive. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE.

Function Description:
Complete the kaprekarNumbers function in the editor below.

kaprekarNumbers has the following parameter(s):

- int p: the lower limit
- int q: the upper limit

Prints:
It should print the list of modified Kaprekar numbers, space-separated on one line and in ascending order.
If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE. No return value is required.

Input Format:
The first line contains the lower integer limit p.
The second line contains the upper integer limit q.

Note: Your range should be inclusive of the limits.

Constraints:
0 < p < q < 100000

Sample Input:
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
1       p = 1
100     q = 100

Sample Output:
1 9 45 55 99

Explanation:
1, 9, 44, 55, and 99 are the modified Kaprekar Numbers in the given range.
